/** This class implements the "retrieve-to" primitive for the factbase extension. Retrieve-to works the same as retrieve in that it uses a 
 * ReporterTask and a List of field names as the condition that facts have to satisfy to be included in the result. The only difference is
 * that you can also specify which fields should be included in the result. So the result does not contain whole facts but only specific parts of 
 * the selected facts.
 * 
 * To call this primitive from NetLogo, use <code>factbase:retrieve <i>fact-base</i> <i>condition-task</i> <i>condition-field-list</i> <i>output-field-list</i></code>
